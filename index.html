        <p class="box">Welcome to my webpage! I'm a 23 year old aspiring developer and a full time cat enthusiast. In my young life I have acheived many deeply admirable and challenging feats including surviving 4 years at U of T and singlehandedly keeping the Backstreet Boys relevant (2010 - present). My skills include speaking three languages,  napping on command, and being a mediocre bass-player/guitarist.  </p>    
        <p class="box">I'll admit I don't actually go to the gym as much as claim to, and I've been known to routinely hit snooze (and still sleep past my alarm); but I'm extremely passionate and open-minded, and there is nothing that I love more than learning and growing. I'm excited to embark on this web development adventure, and though I know it won't be easy, I'm prepared to give it 100%</p>
